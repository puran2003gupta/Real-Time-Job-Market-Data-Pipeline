**Project Description: Job Market Analytics ETL Pipeline**
This project is an end-to-end data engineering solution designed to collect, process, and analyze job market data for generating actionable insights. 
It demonstrates industry-standard practices using AWS services-S3, GLUE, Lambda, IAM, CLoudWatch, Snowflake, and Tableau, making it an excellent showcase of modern data engineering skills.

**Objective**
To build a scalable ETL pipeline that extracts job listings from a public API, processes and stores them in a cloud data warehouse, and visualizes trends for analytics.

**Architecture Overview**
1. Data Source:
Public Job API (Adzuna) providing job listings for multiple roles across India.

2. Data Ingestion:
AWS Lambda function fetches job data for multiple roles (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Engineer, AI Engineer) dynamically.
Data is stored in Amazon S3 in JSON format under a structured folder hierarchy.

3. Data Processing:
AWS Glue (optional) or Snowflake SQL scripts for cleaning and transforming data.
Normalization of job titles, locations, and extraction of structured fields like:
Year, Month from posting date
Skills (Python, SQL, Spark, AWS, Snowflake, etc.)
Job category and company name

4.Data Storage:
Snowflake acts as the cloud data warehouse.
Raw data loaded from S3 using COPY INTO.
Transformed data stored in an analytics table:
adzuna_job_data_analytics with columns for normalized titles, company, location, skills, and time dimensions.

5.Data Cleaning & Transformation:
Remove duplicates using ROW_NUMBER() logic.
Normalize text fields (lowercase, trim spaces).
Extract skills using keyword matching.
Create derived columns for year, month, and city-level aggregations.

6.Analytics Layer:
Create Snowflake Views for:
Top Hiring Companies
Most In-Demand Job Roles
Job Trends by Location and Time
Skill Popularity

7.Visualization:
Tableau Dashboard connected to Snowflake.
Interactive charts:
Bar chart for Top Hiring Companies
Treemap for Job Roles
Line chart for Job Trends by Month and City
Skill distribution summary


**Key Features**
Dynamic Role Fetching: Lambda fetches multiple job roles in one execution.
Cloud-Native Architecture: Fully serverless using AWS Lambda, S3, and Snowflake.
Data Quality: Deduplication, normalization, and enrichment with skill flags.
Scalable Analytics: Views for quick insights and dashboards for visualization.
Business Impact: Helps identify hiring trends, skill demand, and location-based opportunities.


**Tech Stack**
AWS: Lambda, S3, Glue (optional)
Snowflake: Data warehouse, SQL transformations, analytics views
Python: API integration, ETL logic
Tableau: Dashboard and reporting
Adzuna API: Job data source




**End-to-End ETL Pipeline Flow: Job Market Analytics**
1. Data Source Identification
Source: Public job listings (Adzuna https://www.adzuna.com/)
Format:JSON files.


2. Data Ingestion Layer
Tool: Python script or AWS Lambda
Task: Scrape or fetch job data periodically
Output: Raw data stored in Amazon S3 (raw zone)

3. Data Processing Layer
Tool: AWS Glue (PySpark)
Tasks:
Clean and normalize job titles, locations, salaries, etc.
Parse dates, remove duplicates, handle missing values
Add derived columns (e.g., job category, experience level)
Output: Transformed data stored in Amazon S3 (processed zone)=

4. Orchestration Layer
Tool: AWS Step Functions
Flow:
Trigger Lambda for ingestion
Run Glue job for transformation
Load data into Snowflake
Send success/failure notification

5. Data Loading Layer
Tool: Snowflake
Steps:
Create database, schema, and tables
Use Snowpipe or Python connector to load data from S3
Apply clustering and partitioning for performance

6. Analytics Layer
Tool: Snowflake SQL / BI Tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)
Tasks:
Query job trends by location, title, salary
Identify in-demand skills and roles
Generate dashboards and reports

7. Monitoring & Alerts
Tool: CloudWatch + Lambda
Tasks:
Monitor pipeline status
Send email alerts on failure (SMTP + Outlook integration)
